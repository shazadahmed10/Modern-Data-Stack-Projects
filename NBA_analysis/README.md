## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end modern data pipeline, from automated ingestion to business-ready dashboards. The goal is to showcase the integration of multiple tools and the transformation of raw data into insights.

**Pipeline:** Fivetran → Snowflake → dbt → Power BI

**Business Question:** What data points are in the epi analysis datasets and what are some trends they may point to?



## 📂 Repo Structure
| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `/data` | Example raw data |
| `/sql` | SQL scripts for Snowflake |
| `/screenshots` | Visual evidence of pipeline steps |
| `/documentation` | Tool-specific notes & setup steps |
| `/visualizations` | Power BI files |


## 🔍 Key Learnings
- Building a **bronze-silver-gold** data model
- Automating ingestion with Fivetran
- Writing modular SQL transformations
- Connecting Power BI to Snowflake for live dashboards

## ▶ How to Reproduce
1. Set up a Snowflake account (free trial in this case).
2. Create a Fivetran connector from Google Sheets to Snowflake.
3. Run SQL scripts from a snowflake worksheet to go from bronze to silver layer.
4. Connect Power BI to Snowflake, do additional manipulations to go from silver layer to gold layer, and build visuals.
